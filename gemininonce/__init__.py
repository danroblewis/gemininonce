"""gemininonce: a tiny fix-and-test loop that drives Gemini *web* via browser automation.

No API, no tool calls. We send files + test output as a chat message, ask Gemini to reply in a
strict format (FILE: <path> + full contents, COMMAND: + shell command), scrape the rendered reply
from the DOM, write the files, and re-run the test command until it passes.
